# Comment (write after the mark #) are ignored by Python
# Function are mini-programs in your program
# print ( ) displays the value passed to it
# input ( ) lets user type in a value
# len ( ) takes a string value and returns an integre value of the string's lenght
# int ( ), str ( ), and float ( ) convert values' data type
# Bolean data type only have True or False (YES : True, False) (NO: TRUE,false,'True'), True or False must be written with capital T for True and capital F for False and the rest must be in lower case
# Comparison Operator ==  Equals to
# Comparison Operator != Not equal to
# Comparison Operator < less than
# Comparison Operator > Greater than
# Comparison opertor <= Less than or equal to
# Comparison operator >= Greater than or equal to
# comparison operator will result in Boleean value
# and operator wil return to True only if both argument are True
# or operator will return to False only if both argument are False but if only on of the argument is False then it will return to True
# not operator will operate to the opposite of the boleean value


#if statement used for conditional code execution
# An elif (that is , "else if') can folow an if statement. it block executes if its condition is True and all of the previous conditions have been False.
#An else statement come at the end. it's block executed if all of the previous condition have been False.


#While statement is used for iterartion or looping
#press ctrl (cmd) + C to interupt an infinite loop
#A break statement cause the execution to immediately leave the loop, without re-checking the condition
#A continue statement cause the execution to immediately jump back to the start of the loop and re-check the condition

#for loop will loop a specific number of times --> for ... in range ...
#the range ( ) function called with one, two or three arguments
#break and continue can be used in for loops

#import modules and get access to new functions
#the module that come with Python are called standard library
#instal third-party modules using pip tool
#sys.exit() function will immediately quit your program
#the pyperclip third-party module has copy() and paste() functions for reading and writing text to the clipboard.
